cd = change directory 
mkdir   =  mkdir directory
ls = list [files and directory ]
cd ~ (~ =tilter) ~
cd ~ (change directory to home directory)
~ =home directory.
touch  =  creates a file 
 examples with touch commands:
 touch price
 touch cars 
 touch students
 touch fruits. 
 vi =  (allows to to open a file)

 difference files and directories : 
 cd price
 Note:  we cant cd into a file:
...................................
git config = usename and email:
identifies teams operations and activties on files.
git config --global user.name "Lion Tech Academy"
You
git config --global user.email "dev@tararoutray.com"
git init
git status  (check the status files)
git add 
git add .  (add all the files in the working area)
git add price (added just price)
working area
git commit -m "message"  
git log = verify the recent commit
git remote add [alias] url [git repository]
IQ:  Describe your git workflow:
create directory :  mkdir [foldername]
create the filess {touch command}  e.g (touch price)
git add .
git commit 
git log 
git push to the remote area. 
git init = initialize the git local repo
git branch
local repo and remote repo:

Today's Program: 
git clone 
git push 
git branch 
pull request.

devop = dev + operations:
SDLC before devops
developers used to deliver software as a whole. 
Education management software = developers would deliver this application in delivery= lump sum
devopers = plan = building = codes: write applications = 
window:/ silos:
Operations = take the software to the endusers 
are not in the loop
oxford university = email respond: 
Git  = Distributed versions control system: 
Repository = devlopers, operations, project respository
push codes to the repository = operations is able to test, operate and provide feedback
project manager = acts as mediator between  tech(developers and operations) and non tech team
Project manager = ops , i think we need to add transcript request (features) 
what happens if the new feature is not working well.  6 months
That is why Devops Git is solving this problem:
DevOps is not a job title: 
DevOps is a practice /methodology on software development life cycle:
How manay software did you use today
microsoft =
zooms = millions of users
whatsapp = these applications has features
telegram 
bank app
with devops , the whatsap can be be developed in parts: 
what are the features of the whatsap application : 
Lion Tech was contracted to build the whatsap app. 
(groups, chats, calls, media, videos, audio, gifs,)
Lion Tech is going to create a github account + repositories. 
Github = dev + ops + qa + project managers 
group is developed and pushed tp github repo : 
take the codes and build/package/ 
u want to took rice and stew :
fish
tin tomatoes
onion
rice
someone needs to mixed the igredents together. before rice and stew would be available for
consumption
DevOps engineers is a subject matter expert:
dev       dev/ops engineer         ops
standup meetings.
DAILY STANDUP MEETINGS  = 15 minutes
what did you work on yestewrday 
what challenges did you encounter 
what would be working on today.
project manager /scrum master

Do DevOps engineers write application codes : NO. 
AUtomation expert = automation and sdlc = devops
it falls in the versions control system = 
devops = cicd  = continouse delivery and deployment. 
Software = 
we dont develope software a lump:
develop in parts = tested = feedback = developers get faster feedback
cicd comes = devops engineer. = backend guy. 
before workday = images the nighware the hr managers: 
Nowadays :
software is all about : 
speed to the market  = fast 
security 
reliability 
changes = how often are changes made to the applciation 
what for business is a new feature: 
git and github is helping us to acieve collaboration:
IQ:  what is your experience with git. 
.......................................................
Local environment  = your house = local environment.
local = close to your = local community
remote environment  = github

........................
Authenticating with your github account. 
PAT :  personal access token = complicated password generated github. 
git clone 
modified the files clones 
git remote add [alias]
git status
